Description of the Game
In League of Legends, two teams face of to play a game, where every player choses a champion and then controles them in the game
this is a simulation of the picking of the champions that happen pregame.
the two teams(blue and red), takes turns to ban or choose champions for their team
blue goes first

a player can see all the champions he can choose in the upper part of the screen, this list continues onto other pages
which can be viewed by clicking on the left or right arrows on the screen
furthermore you can find specific champions by filling the search field and clicking "search"

turns arent always swapped every pick, under is a explanation of the sequence

first they take single turns to ban 3 champions each

then blue picks 1 champion to his team
then the red player pick 2
blue then picks 2
and red pick 1.
now each player has banned 3 and picked 3

then they both take single turns banning 2 more champions

which then is followed by red picking one champ
blue 2
and then red ends it all with the last pick

now both players have banned 5 champions and picked 5 each
